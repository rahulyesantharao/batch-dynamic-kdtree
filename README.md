# Parallel, Batch-Dynamic kd-Tree
## About
This repository contains code for our paper: Parallel Batch-Dynamic kd-Trees. It contains an implementation of a logarithmically-structured parallel batch-dynamic kd-tree as well as several baseline implementations of parallel batch-dynamic kd-trees.

## Support 
This code has not been cleaned up since the release and is still in a research-phase. Please contact the developers or paper authors if you encounter any problems.
